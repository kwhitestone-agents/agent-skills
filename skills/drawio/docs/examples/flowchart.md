# Flowchart Examples

Example prompts for creating flowcharts with Draw.io Skill.

## Simple Process Flow

> "Create a simple process flow with 4 steps: Start → Initialize → Process → End"

## Decision Flow

> "Draw a flowchart for user login:
> - User enters credentials
> - Check if credentials are valid
> - If valid: Login successful
> - If invalid: Show error and retry"

## Loop Process

> "Create a flowchart showing a data processing loop:
> - Start
> - Read data
> - Is there more data? (decision)
> - If yes: Process data → Go back to read
> - If no: Save results → End"

## Complex Business Process

> "Draw an order processing flowchart:
> - Customer places order
> - Validate inventory
> - If out of stock: Notify customer → End
> - If in stock: Process payment
> - If payment fails: Retry payment (max 3 times)
> - If payment successful: Ship order
> - Send confirmation → End"

## Error Handling Flow

> "Create a flowchart with error handling:
> - Start process
> - Try to execute operation
> - If error occurs: Log error
> - Check if error is recoverable
> - If yes: Retry operation
> - If no: Alert administrator → End
> - If no error: Continue to next step → End"

## Parallel Processing

> "Draw a flowchart showing parallel tasks:
> - Start
> - Split into 3 parallel tasks: Task A, Task B, Task C
> - Wait for all tasks to complete
> - Merge results
> - End"

## Tips for Flowchart Prompts

- **Be explicit about connections**: Use "→" or "then" to show flow
- **Describe decision points**: Use "if/then/else" language
- **Specify node types**: Mention "start", "end", "decision", "process"
- **Include loops**: Clearly describe when to go back to previous steps
