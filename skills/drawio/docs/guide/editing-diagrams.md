# Editing Diagrams

Learn how to modify and refine existing diagrams.

## Editing Operations

### Modifying Node Properties

Change the appearance or content of specific nodes:

> "Change the background color of the 'Process Data' node to light blue"

> "Add a bold border to all decision nodes"

### Adding Nodes

Insert new elements into your diagram:

> "Add a 'Log Error' node after the 'Payment Failed' node"

> "Insert a decision node between 'Validate Input' and 'Process Data' to check if input is valid"

### Connecting Nodes

Create edges between nodes:

> "Connect the 'Start' node to the 'Validate Input' node with an arrow"

> "Add a curved connection from 'Database' to 'Cache' labeled 'sync'"

### Deleting Elements

Remove nodes or connections:

> "Remove the 'Temporary Storage' node and its connections"

## Advanced Editing

### Batch Operations

Apply changes to multiple elements:

> "Make all process nodes have a light gray background"

> "Add rounded corners to all rectangle nodes"

### Layout Adjustments

Reorganize your diagram:

> "Arrange the nodes in a horizontal layout"

> "Create a grid layout for the service nodes with 3 columns"

### Style Refinement

Fine-tune visual appearance:

> "Make the connection lines thicker and use a dark gray color"

> "Add drop shadows to all nodes"

## Working with Cell IDs

For precise editing, you can reference specific cells by their IDs:

1. Ask Claude to show cell IDs:
   > "Show me the cell IDs in this diagram"

2. Edit using IDs:
   > "Change the text of cell J5 to 'New Process Name'"

3. Modify properties by ID:
   > "Set the fill color of cell J3 to #FF6B6B"

## Tips for Effective Editing

1. **Be Descriptive**: Clearly describe what you want to change
2. **Reference Context**: Use nearby nodes as reference points
3. **Iterate**: Make small changes and review the results
4. **Use Preview**: Check the browser preview after each change
